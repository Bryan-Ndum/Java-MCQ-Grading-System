# Grading System Project

## Overview

This project automates the grading of student exams based on teacher-provided solutions. It was developed in Java using Eclipse IDE.

## Description

### Project Setup

1. **Creating Project Structure:**
   - Created a folder named "Final Project OOP" on the desktop.
   - Set this folder as the workspace in Eclipse.

2. **Folder Organization:**
   - Inside "Final Project OOP," established a sub-folder named "Grading."
   - Created a "Student" folder within "Grading," containing individual student exam answers.
   - Added a file named "Solutions.txt" in the "Grading" folder for teacher solutions.

### Java Classes

1. **Exam Class:**
   - Contains constructors and methods for handling individual student exams.

2. **Teacher Class:**
   - Manages file paths and methods for grading multiple student exams against solutions.

3. **TestGrading Class:**
   - Main method to execute grading, writing results to "StudentScore.txt" and statistical data to another file.

## Challenges Faced

### Problem Encountered

- Difficulty accessing files within the project structure from Eclipse.
  
### Solution

- Adjusted file path definitions in Java classes, ensuring correct referencing (e.g., corrected "Solution.txt" to "src/Grading/Solutions.txt").
- Consulted course materials and external resources for guidance on Java file handling.

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of precise file path management in Java projects.
- Value of revisiting foundational concepts and leveraging diverse learning resources for problem-solving.
